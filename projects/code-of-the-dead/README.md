# Zombie Tactics (WIP)

**Zombie Tactics** is an unfinished 2D zombie shooter game built with Python, developed as a personal project to learn and practice core programming concepts.

The game centers around a tactical squad of four soldiers who automatically shoot approaching enemies. It explores different layers of game logic, including AI behavior, health and ammo systems, and dynamic difficulty through wave progression.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project started as a learning exercise to get comfortable with Python by creating something fun, interactive, and progressively more complex. While incomplete, it includes several mechanics that helped me explore object-oriented programming, collision detection, and simple game AI.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- 👥 **4-soldier tactical squad**  
  Each soldier targets and fires at nearby zombies automatically.

- 🧟 **Enemy AI**  
  Zombies move toward the player group in increasing waves of difficulty.

- ❤️ **Health System**  
  Every character (player and enemy) has its own health bar.

- 🔫 **Ammo Management**  
  Soldiers have limited magazine capacity and must reload.

- 🌊 **Progressive Horde Waves**  
  Each level becomes more challenging with more and faster zombies.

## 🚧 Project Status

- The game is a **work in progress** and not fully playable.
- Graphics and core logic are implemented at a basic level.
- No menus, save system, or sound included at this stage.

## 📚 Built With

- Python
- Pygame (for rendering and event handling)

## ✍️ Personal Notes

While the game isn't complete, it was a great hands-on experience for learning Python fundamentals, especially around object-oriented design and AI behavior. I plan to revisit this project in the future with new skills and ideas.
